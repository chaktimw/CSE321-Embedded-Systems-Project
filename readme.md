# About
  This repository will contain the project files created over the course of the semester (Fall 2021) for the class cse321. 
  The projects include the following: project 1, project 2, and project 3.
  
## Project 1
  The goal of project 1 is to prepare for design implementations in future projects by creating a base reference guide and setting up an environment.
    
## Project 2
  The goal of project 2 is to implement an alarm/timer system using the Nucleo embedded platform.
    
## Project 3
  The purpose of project 3 is to create a real-time embedded system that can be used to help solve a problem. 
  For this project, the chosen input peripheral is DHT11, and the chosen output peripheral is the LCD. The goal is to use these peripherals with the Nucleo embedded platform to determine the current humidity and temperature of the surroundings, and display that on the LCD.
